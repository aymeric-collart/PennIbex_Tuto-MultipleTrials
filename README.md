# Tutorial for PennIbex, example with one trial

The code of this repository is taken from the PennController Github's page (link: https://github.com/PennController/TimedPictureSelection).

This code corresponds to the code that is obtained after following the tutorial of pcIBEX (link: https://www.pcibex.net/wiki/00-overview/), from step 1 to 7. Therefore, the experiment consists of one single trial.

Comments after each line of code, describing the function of them, are mine.

# How to use this code?

1. Go to the website of pcIBEX (https://expt.pcibex.net/), and open a session.
2. Create a new experiment, and name it as you want.
3. Click on your new experiment, and click on "update from git repo".
4. In "repo url", copy and paste "https://github.com/aymeric-collart/PennIbex_Tuto-1trial", then click on "sync"

You can try the experiment, and change anything as you wish!
